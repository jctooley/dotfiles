# Introduction

This respository is going to grow over time, but the intention is to have a centralised repository for all my dot files. I have taken inspiration from Andrew Burgess [repository](https://github.dev/andrew8088/dotfiles). I am building this from scratch as a learning exercise in scripts as well as other things that will come up ðŸ˜Ž.

## How does it work?

The idea is there is going be an installation script that will create simlink files to all dot files in this repository.
